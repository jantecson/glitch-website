          A compilation of the research I've done during my time taking User
          Centered Research and Evaluation. Throughout the Spring 2023 semester,
          we researched ways to incentivize TikTok users to report biased ads
          due to AI algorithms.

          As a team of 5, we created a simple yet powerful solution that would

        First, I began with finding some background information on algorithmic
        bias. I looked through different definitions I found online and even
        cited my own feed. As I perused my social media apps, I realized that
        there was a lot more algorithmic bias towards my own preferences. We can
        also see algorithmic bias as harmful, which is seen through looking up
        the word 'fashion' on Instagram. Looking this up would give us pictures
        of predominantely white and skinny women, which perpetuates the idea
        that 'fashion' belongs to certain type of person. Although our group
        ultimately settled with TikTok's biases within their ads, the initial
        background research done gave us good insights into what we should be
        particularly focusing on.

          I created the graphs made to help practice analyzing data for future
          reports. I also asisted in interpreting these graphs. For example,
          from the graphs I made, I derived the hypothesis where I found that
          Tweets that had the most likes pertain to Twitter cropping because it
          happened on the platform itself. Twitter cropping also occurred
          without the consent of the users. However, Portrait AI is done by the
          users and the users would often share or retweet other Tweets that are
          related to Portrait AI due to popularity and trends.

          Since this was our first Think Aloud Protocol, we had to first create
          the process for it. I assisted in writing the introduction and thought
          of the three different tasks the user should go through when doing the
          protocol.
          <br />
          <br />
          Next, we tested out our Think Aloud Protocol. I did this with a user
          and with Instagram Reels. At this time, we were still focused on
          Instagram and did not make the change to TikTok yet. We decided to
          switch to TikTok later on due to TikTok's implicit algorithmic bias
          and we became more interested in TikTok's algortihm over Instagram
          (and another group in our recitation was doing Instagram haha).

          During this Think Aloud, I tested with two Instagram users and they
          scrolled through their Instagram reels to see if the ads the received
          were biased towards their preferences. Since one user used Instagram
          quite a lot, their ads were catered towards things they were
          interested in while the other user would gets ads they were not too
          interested in.
          <br />
          <br />
          From the Think Aloud, I found that users were unlikely to report
          Instagram Reel ads because there were limited reporting reasons and
          that the users would usually just skip the ads instead. I later
          observed the same behavior with TikTok ads thus the transition between
          the two social media platforms was not too drastic. From this, I found
          problems that I aimed to solve.

          example, I stated that "We can make reporting biased ads more
          intuitive and work with others (such as those who make algorithms that
          decide which ad is shown) to try and make ads more catered and less
          harmful towards the user." as a design need.

        After synthesizing our data together by walking the wall, we decided to
        solidy our project defintion. We asked: "How might we make finding /
        reporting biases in TikTok ads that appear because of AI algorithms more
        intuitive for everyday users?" I then thought of supporting tasks, such
        as interviewing TikTok users and discussing ads that they commonly see
        and asking whether the user believes they are biased or not. In addition
        to this, users would have to determine whether or not they would
        realisticly report the ad during an everyday setting. I then decided
        that this project would impact everyday TikTok users, developers of
        TikTok, and the people who pay for ads

        will be. I helped with figuring out the hurdle of inaction. I asked "How
        can we incentivize TikTok users to identify biases in their ads and
        report them?" From this, I helped with synthesizing smaller questions
        and figuring out hypothetical solutions to them.

        decided to do another Think Aloud Protocol but with TikTok. We managed
        to pilot test the guide with other UCRE students to ensure that our
        interview guide is not asking too much and it suffcies for an average
        interview about TikTok ad biases.

        Although we were not within eachother's immediate social circle, the
        interactions went well as I gained more insight in how the user
        interacted with TikTok ads. I learned that some people will immediately
        skip over an ad if they noticed that it is tagged with 'sponsored.' I
        then took interpretation notes of what I noticed from the reseach

        It helped me understand our users needs and it helped power my ideas
        behind the implementations we were brainstorming to add to TikTok's
        interface. I began thinking in the shoes of an average, everyday TikTok

          <b> The Survey </b>

      <h5 class="content-words w3-left-align">
        We practiced designing and conducting a survey to inform our research
        project on algorithmic bias auditing. By reviewing and analyzing our
        previously tested Think Aloud Users, I helped narrow down our target
        demographic. From this, I came up with questions that probed the survey
        taker about their thoughts on TikTok ads, the ad biases, how they report
        ads, and if those ads were difficult to report. Remember, our aim is to
        figure out how to incentivze the users to report more ads that may be
        triggering or harmfully biased towards them or others.
        <br />
        <br />
        We pilot tested the survey with others before fully sending out the
        survey. I was able to get a sizeable amount of people to answer our
        survey through my connections on Discord and advertising in person to
        others I knew in passing.

        We analyzed the data from our survey and came up with results. I helped
        with analyzing the data and understanding what the users needed. In
        particular, I realized that TikTok does little to handle complaints or
        encourage users to report ads. Users would be willing to report ads but
        TikTok gives them a non-intuitve way to report ads. This helped give me
        and my group ideas on how to solve this issue.

      <h5 class="content-words w3-left-align">
        I made eight individual storyboards and ultimately chose three of them
        to show our user testers. Overall, we had fifteen storyboards (three
        from each member). The first storyboard I made was safe and confortable
        for the user, the second is progressively riskier, and the final one was
        intentionally risky, and tested the social boundaries for a social media
        app. I then tested all of the storyboards with users to see how they
        would feel about these storyboards. From these storyboards, we chose the
        ones our users positively responded to the best.

        We started creating our prototype. We first decided on what our
        prototype will include. We decided to implement one of my ideas of
        including a report button that the user can click and it will lead them
        directly towards the report page. Another implementation that helped to
        add in our prototype was showing visual statistics of what other users
        reported the ad for. I then wrote about our riskiest assumptions when
        making this prototype as it would mean that users would be incentivized
        to report the ad. However, users may not feel the need to and completely
        skip over our implementation.

      <h5 class="content-words w3-left-align">
        I decided that we should make our prototype on Figma. By using Figma, it
        gives the user the experience of testing the real product. By making it
        Lo-Fi, the user understands that this is not a real working prototype,
        but only just a prototype. I described our prototype as well as outlined
        the ususal task a user would go through when reporting an ad and how our
        implementation would help their experience become more intuitive and
        efficient.

      <h5 class="content-words w3-left-align">
        From our Lo-Fi prototype, I learned that our users found the
        'exclamation point' button useful as reporting an ad is only one click
        away. One point I noticed was that users would skim the statistics of
        others who reported the ad before. From this, I decided that we should
        put a heavier emphasis on the report options themselves. We can give the
        user some space to write about why that ad is being reported for the
        selected reason. We can then hide the statistics and allow it to be a
        toggled option if the user wants to know what others reported the ad
        for. I helped decided our final changes and the next steps we were
        planning on taking.

        Since i did a sizeable amount of the work within the group (probably a
        good 35%), I must have missed something within this blog post. I did
        link all the projects to the best of my knowledge so hopefully its
        exhaustive!
        <br />
        <br />
        For the most part, I enjoyed working with my team with this project. It
        was an interesting problem statement that was presented to us and we
        handled it with care. After taking this course and going through all of
        the modules, I believe I learned a lot and everything I've learned in
        this course will be applied to my future in research. I'm definitely
        excited to start other research projects and maybe, one day, I will come
        back to this page and see how far I've progressed (or utilize this
        research for another project lol).
