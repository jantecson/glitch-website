          We aim to gather feedback from the player community on the types of

          in Riot Games. This will help us foster a more positive and less toxic

          delivering high-quality experiences while prioritizing the well-being
          of both people and the planet. In today's retail and service
          industries, companies face increasing demands to offer more

        <h5>
          Coincidentally, everyone in my team enjoyed playing games, especially
          games made by Riot Games. We all decided, as a joke, to do our
          research on Riot, specifically on League of Legends and Valorant.
          Unbeknownst to us, it would lead us to powerful insights and drive me
          to learn more about the gaming community.

        <h4>
          <b> . . . And Why Cosmetic Skins? </b>
        </h4>
        <h5>
          Cosmetic skins server several important purposes, making them a
          valuable addition to the gaming experience. This includes
          self-expression, status and achievement, support for the game the
          creators, and a sense of identity and engagement.

      <h5 class="content-words w3-left-align">
        Initially, our focus was solely on the cosmetic designs themselves.
        However, after interviewing Riot Games players, we realized we could
        expand our hypothesis by exploring how players could share their skins
        with one another to enhance social equity within the player base.
        <br />
        <br />
        After discussing our findings with our supporting professor, Raelin
        Musucara, we identified a challenge: our skin-sharing system didn't
        account for how Riot Games would generate profit from this
        implementation. This posed a significant difficulty, as our goal was to
        assist players who have limited time and financial resources. To address
        this, we evolved our approach to include offering discounts, enabling
        players to afford their own skins.
        <br />
        <br />
        <div id="background"></div>
        Reflecting on our research, it’s clear how much our ideas have evolved.
        We shifted from focusing on individual player support through skins to
        fostering a system where veteran players can assist novice players. Our
        solution ultimately benefits both the community and Riot Games, creating
        a positive and inclusive environment for all.

          From gathering observational research (watching people play League of

          created a board that started with just our initial thoughts. We then
          clustered them into bigger and overarching ideas that summarized the
          user experience well.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a result of careful observation and experimentation from each of
          us, we were able to create multiple clusters of different consumer
          behaviors. This primarily revolve around their interactions with the
          in-game service, weapon skins, and their relative performance based on
          game and player interaction. By the end of the process, it was
          generally true that skins affected the players’ performance and how
          they interact with other parts of the game (teammates, enemy members,
          others skins, etc), whether it improved or worsened their
          game-experience. This was also generally true throughout varying
          different skill levels of players.

          In this analysis, I explored the League of Legends player persona
          within the Riot Games community, identifying key behavioral patterns
          and user needs. Players consistently experience community toxicity,
          yet they engage socially, valuing interactions and the shared
          experience of gameplay. There is a strong desire for a more rewarding
          game experience, particularly through improved aesthetics and a wider
          variety of cosmetic options. Communication and positivity within the
          community are also critical areas of focus.
          <br /><br />
          However, distinct differences emerged among players. Casual players
          tend to have lower investment levels and prioritize inclusivity, often
          refusing to engage in toxic behavior, whereas others seek competitive
          play and enjoy showcasing their achievements through cosmetics. The
          perception of the Riot Games ecosystem also varies; while some players
          feel represented and enjoy the competitive environment, others express
          dissatisfaction and may consider discontinuing play.

          motivations and concerns, particularly around toxicity, communication,
          and personal gratification, to enhance the overall user experience.

          After developing the gamer persona, I extended the research by

          process revealed several critical gaps in understanding how to foster
          a more positive and less toxic community through cosmetic content. Key
          questions emerged, such as how to bridge the gap between players with
          differing resources (time and money), how to ensure mutual benefits
          between these groups, and how Riot Games can simultaneously drive
          revenue while promoting a positive community atmosphere.

          To address these gaps, I proposed a comprehensive plan to gather

          preferences and behaviors related to cosmetic purchases, conducting
          interviews with a diverse range of players—from newcomers to
          veterans—and reaching out to industry insiders, including Riot Games
          employees. The goal is to synthesize this data to inform strategies
          that balance community satisfaction with business objectives, such as
          the potential introduction of skin exchanges, satisfaction guarantees,
          or community-driven events. These insights will be crucial in refining

        Finally, as a group, we deliberated on which low-fidelity prototype to
        advance with, ultimately selecting my prototype. The decision was
        influenced by the incentives my design offered to both inexperienced and
        experienced players, as well as its demonstrated potential for seamless
        integration within League of Legends and other Riot Games titles.

        With this final low-fidelity prototype, we created a list of notes for
        improving this prototype and implementing it within our high-fidelity

        In assessing our prototype's realism, we focused on several key aspects:
        <br /><br />
        <b>Visual Realism:</b> The prototype incorporates authentic screenshots
        from League of Legends' queuing and matching screens. Our design aligns
        visually with the game's style, enhancing its authenticity. <br /><br />
        <b>Interaction Realism:</b> Although we used a Figma prototype to
        simulate interactions, the experience isn't as refined as we would like
        due to limitations in modifying the actual game. <br /><br />
        <b>Breadth:</b> The prototype covers only the initial phase where
        players queue up, excluding the gameplay itself. It focuses solely on
        the character and role selection screens. <br /><br />
        <b>Depth: </b>Users are limited by the Figma prototype's constraints, as
        they can only interact with the selected characters and cannot
        experience gameplay beyond the demonstration phase. <br /><br />
        <b>Content Realism:</b> By utilizing actual gameplay screenshots, our
        prototype immerses users in a familiar context, providing a realistic
        sense of how our proposed features would integrate into the League of
        Legends environment.

        After this summer, I feel significantly more confident in applying a
        human-centered design process. My previous experience laid the
        foundation, but this research has deepened my understanding.
        Collaborating with my team, Raelin, and our mentors provided valuable
        insights into initiating and leading a successful research project. This
        experience has reinforced my passion for pursuing a career in product
        management, particularly in the gaming industry, where I am eager to
        engage in more research and development.
