          We proposed an innovative solution designed to transform the museum
          experience for visually impaired visitors, while also enhancing the
          experience for all participants. MuseTouch leverages Internet of
          Things (IoT), Conversational AI Chatbots, and Smart Technologies to
          create a 4D immersive experience from 2D paintings. By partnering with
          free-to-the-public museums, our goal is to provide an inclusive
          environment where visually impaired individuals can navigate exhibits
          independently.
          <br />
          <br />
          Visitors would wear headphones and haptic gloves, allowing them to
          interact with conversational AI, while immersive sounds and tactile
          feedback deepen their understanding and connection with the artwork
          and its creators. This project addresses the critical need to make art
          more accessible, opening up new opportunities for engagement and
          inclusion in the museum space.

          <b> Why Art Museums? </b>
        </h4>
        <h5>
          We selected art museums as the focus for our technologies. While art
          museums provide diverse and enriching experiences to visitors, they
          also present significant challenges. Most notably, exhibitions are
          predominantly visual and typically prohibit touching the artworks.
          This environment can be particularly exclusionary for visually
          impaired visitors. Motivated by these challenges, we committed
          ourselves to innovating a solution that would make art museums
          accessible to everyone.
          <br />

      <div class="content-words w3-left-align">
        <h4>
          <b> The Importance of Accessibility in Museums </b>
        </h4>
        <h5>
          In the course of developing our immersive experience for visually
          impaired individuals in museums, we undertook several explorations
          that informed our concept. Technically, we integrated a tactile tablet
          with touch sensors, bluetooth headphones, and LiDAR technology to
          detect how users interact with the environment. These IoT elements
          allow our Conversational AI to respond dynamically, fostering
          meaningful interactions. Users engage with the system through
          headphones, a microphone, and a haptic tablet, enabling a
          multi-sensory experience.
          <br />
          <br />
          Market research highlighted a significant gap: existing tools for
          visually impaired museum visitors are limited to basic aids or
          monotone text-to-speech systems, which fail to provide a truly
          immersive experience. By addressing this gap, we aim to create an
          inclusive environment that enhances the museum experience for all
          visitors, regardless of ability.
          <br />
          <br />
          Additionally, involving artists in the process ensures that their work
          is respected and authentically translated into a 4D model. This
          collaboration preserves the integrity of the artwork while making it
          accessible in a novel, interactive format. Our approach not only opens
          up new possibilities for accessibility but also redefines how art can
          be experienced in a museum setting.

          In our class project, we were assigned the challenge of utilizing IoT
          and Conversational AI Bots. Building on this foundation, we were
          encouraged to integrate smart technologies to create a fully immersive
          museum experience. Our approach aimed to push the boundaries of
          traditional museum interactions, leveraging cutting-edge technology to
          engage users in a dynamic and inclusive way.

          <b> IoT and Conversational AI Bots (AI Chatbots) </b>
        </h4>
        <h5>
          In our preliminary research, we focused on understanding how IoT and
          AI Chatbots could enhance accessibility in public spaces, particularly
          for individuals with disabilities. We identified several key areas
          that could benefit from improved accessibility, such as transportation
          hubs, cultural sites, and museums. These spaces often lack the
          necessary tactile, visual, and auditory aids needed to support all
          visitors, especially those who are visually or cognitively impaired.
          IoT technologies, like touch sensors and beacons, offer opportunities
          to create more interactive and inclusive environments by providing
          automated, context-aware responses to user actions.
          <br /><br />
          For example, in museums, IoT can facilitate optimized route pathing
          and interactive storytelling, making exhibits more accessible and
          engaging. AI-powered chatbots, with their ability to learn and adapt,
          can further enhance these experiences by offering dynamic, real-time
          interactions tailored to the user's needs. By integrating these
          technologies, we aimed to create accessible experiences that are not
          only functional but also enriching, breaking down barriers and
          ensuring that everyone, regardless of ability, can fully engage with
          and enjoy these public spaces.

        <h5>
          During the ideation and matchmaking process, our team utilized a
          structured approach to generate innovative solutions aimed at
          enhancing accessibility and inclusivity in public spaces. We combined
          elements from various categories—such as public spaces, target
          personas, and action verbs—to explore how IoT and conversational AI
          could be leveraged in new and meaningful ways. By brainstorming ideas
          across different contexts, like museums, historical landmarks, and
          national parks, we developed concepts that focused on the unique needs
          of diverse user groups, including individuals with visual impairments,
          mobility disabilities, and language disorders.
          <br />
          <br />
          Through this process, we not only generated a wide range of ideas but
          also refined them by considering real-life scenarios, the potential
          impact on users, and the overall feasibility of implementation. This
          methodical ideation phase allowed us to identify the most promising
          solutions that could be further developed into prototypes, ensuring
          that our designs were both innovative and deeply rooted in
          user-centered principles.

          From our ideation matchmaking, we decided to choose an idea that
          seemed the most unique as we wanted to challenge ourselves with an
          innovative design. This led us to choose national landmarks as our
          public space to assist the disabled using our technology.
        </h5>
        <br /><br />
        <h4>
          <b> National Landmarks are Cool! </b>
        </h4>
        <h5>
          Our initial concept focused on creating small-scale replicas of
          national landmarks embedded with interactive technology to enhance
          accessibility. These models were designed with sensors that would
          activate a conversational AI to provide spoken information, allowing
          visually impaired individuals to "visualize" landmarks through touch
          and sound. We envisioned complementing these models with related
          artifacts, such as textured layouts and miniature dioramas, to create
          a more immersive and tactile experience.
          <br /><br />
          As part of our research, we began by exploring accessibility solutions
          specific to national landmarks. This led us to examine how museums
          have successfully implemented accessibility guidelines, such as using
          miniature sculptures and physical artifacts to help those with
          accommodations engage with exhibits. We were inspired by these
          strategies and considered how they could be applied to national
          landmarks. We initially also explored ideas to assist individuals with
          disabilities in navigating national landmarks but realized that our
          project had become too broad in scope. To ensure a more focused and
          impactful solution, we decided to concentrate on the development of
          national landmark artifacts.
          <br /><br />
        </h5>
        <h4>
          <b> . . . But Museums are Cooler! </b>
        </h4>
        <h5>
          Our pivot to museums was driven by a deeper analysis of technical
          feasibility, financial viability, and user desire for our concepts. We
          recognized that while museums have already made strides in
          accessibility, national landmarks have yet to widely adopt similar
          technologies. This gap presented an opportunity to extend our research
          to national landmarks. Additionally, companies like Tactile Studio
          have successfully replicated models of artwork with embedded
          technology, supporting the viability of our concept. By integrating
          IoT into these models and activating conversational AI through sensor
          mechanisms like touch or heat sensors, we saw a clear path to enhance
          accessibility in both museums and, potentially, national landmarks.
          This realization led us to focus on museums as a starting point, where
          the context and technology could be more effectively applied.

        <h5>
          In our user research phase, we initiated a field study at the Carnegie
          Museum of Art, where we engaged with museum visitors, gallery staff,
          and diversity officers to gain insights into the current state of
          accessibility in museums. These interviews highlighted a universal
          need for enhanced visual accessibility, with one visitor noting, "I
          believe that increasing any visual accessibility in a museum would be
          helpful." However, we found that existing solutions are often limited
          to certain types of art, such as simulated paint strokes, and fail to
          provide a comprehensive experience for all visitors. This gap pointed
          to a demand for a more immersive, interactive exploration of art that
          could be accessible to everyone.
          <br /><br />
          Our literature review supported these findings, revealing a
          significant accessibility gap for blind and visually impaired museum
          visitors. Technologies like audio descriptions and tactile interfaces,
          while beneficial, are not widely adopted. This realization prompted us
          to consider how we could replicate the visual experience of art
          through tactile means, leading us to explore various technological
          solutions.

      </h4>
      <h5 class="content-words w3-left-align">
        To summarize our concept so far, MuseTouch is a cutting-edge solution
        designed to make art accessible to everyone, including those with visual
        impairments. Upon entering the museum, visitors can pick up a set of
        headphones and a tactile tablet. This portable device accompanies them
        throughout the gallery, allowing for an immersive, interactive
        experience.
        <br /><br />
        Equipped with IoT sensors strategically placed around the museum,
        MuseTouch enables users to feel the texture and details of the artwork
        directly on the tablet's tactile screen. As they explore each piece, the
        integrated AI provides real-time guidance, offering insightful
        commentary and engaging in interactive conversations about the art. This
        personalized experience bridges the gap between traditional and
        accessible art viewing, making the museum visit more inclusive and
        enriching for all.

        <br /><br />
        To enhance her experience, an IoT and AI device is introduced. When the
        art is detected by the device's LiDAR sensor, a tactile screen displays
        images of the artwork, allowing Jane to explore it through touch. The AI
        also provides guided narration, enriching her understanding of the
        piece.
        <br /><br />
        Jane's friend can see the same display and engage in meaningful
        discussions about the art with her. This shared experience brings them
        closer, leaving both of them feeling more connected and joyful.

        <br />For MuseTouch, we focused on integrating a tactile device tablet,
        Bluetooth headphones, LiDAR sensors, and conversational AI to create an
        immersive and accessible museum experience. The tactile tablet is
        inspired by the Dot Pad technology, which uses touch sensors to create
        dynamic, raised images. However, MuseTouch goes further by incorporating
        not only raised dots but also paint strokes, enabling users to
        experience both flat and three-dimensional artworks in a tactile form.
        Sculptures, for example, would be represented with raised dots, allowing
        users to feel the contours and details. <br /><br />
        Bluetooth headphones connect seamlessly with the tablet, ensuring a
        personalized audio experience where the conversational AI provides
        guided, immersive narratives about the artwork. This AI is adaptable,
        capable of adjusting its language complexity and speech pace based on
        the user's preferences, thereby making art accessible and engaging for
        everyone without disturbing other visitors.
        <br /><br />
        The experience is further enhanced by LiDAR sensors placed beneath each
        artwork, which detect the proximity of the tablet. As the user
        approaches a piece, the LiDAR triggers the tablet to update its display
        to mirror the artwork above it, ensuring that the tactile representation
        is always relevant to the user’s location in the museum. This setup
        creates a truly interactive and inclusive environment where visually
        impaired visitors can explore art through touch and sound, offering a
        unique way to connect with and appreciate museum collections.

        Overall, this experience has been eye-opening and has shown me how we
        can leverage physical technology to transform learning and exploration
        in public spaces. Our work with MuseTouch, which integrates tactile
        tablets, Bluetooth headphones, LiDAR sensors, and conversational AI,
        illustrates the potential to make museums and other public venues more
        engaging and accessible.
        <br /><br />
        By using the tactile tablet to replicate artwork textures and providing
        real-time updates through LiDAR sensors, we can offer a richer
        experience for everyone, including those with visual impairments. The
        Bluetooth headphones and conversational AI further enhance this by
        offering personalized, immersive narratives that adjust to each user's
        preferences. This approach not only bridges accessibility gaps but also
        ensures that all visitors can connect more deeply with the art and
        history around them. It's exciting to see how these innovations can
        create more inclusive spaces and inspire a broader appreciation of art
        and culture.
