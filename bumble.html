          Hive is a location-based service that helps Bumble users meet one
          another at third places
          <br />
          <br />

          By turning on their location, users will be able to find participating
          Bumble Partner businesses that offer exciting opportunities to meet
          potential partners authentically– while also enjoying the benefits of
          exclusive discounts for new budding couples.
          <br />

            Users</i
          >
          <br />
          <br />

          I utilized data from previously failed Bumble features that involved
          location-based services. From their shortcomings, I analyzed the data
          to figure out how to appeal to the Bumble user demographic. I also
          used the Uber design system to create my new features to practice
          working with a design system and creating components that fits both
          the design system and Bumble aesthetic
          <br />
          <br />
          <br />
          The problem I was trying to solve was how Bumble can create a location
          based service that can attract more users to become paying users. In
          addition to this, I wanted to motivate users who already have their
          location notifications turned on to become subscribers but also
          hopefully motivate users who do not have location notifications on to
          turn them on specifically for Bumble. To continue, my idea can easily
          be converted to match both BFF and Bizz because of its flexibility and
          there is no strong emphasis on necessarily meeting people to date
          them.

        I was given Base as a design system to work with. The components were
        fairly easy to use as they were sleek, simple, and provided good
        insights on how to implement them into Bumble. However, it was tricky to
        make a mostly black and white aesthetic to fit a yellow
        'bumblebee'-esque theme

          From the given data of the two failed features, the adoption rates
          declined but the “Map Integration for Nearby Events” seemed to be more
          successful compared to the “Proximity Alert”.This helped influence me
          to use the map integration component to enhance the social aspect of
          the app. By adding upon that feature with discounts and having the
          ability to see people in the area, it may keep adoption and retention
          rates high.

          I believe that designers should rely on data to make their decisions
          to some extent. Data can only bring designers so far and they should
          rely on their creativity and also utilize their own tests, strategies,
          and interviews when designing.

          There are times where it is more appropriate to use data. For example,
          if there are overwhelming large numbers of positive or negative data
          points, it signals to the designer that something about the feature is
          extremely good or bad. However, data that seems mixed (which it
          usually is), should help the designer think about the issue at hand
          rather than immediately shutting something down.

        To help mask users and keep their privacy, I introduced single bee

        and an icebreaker. The user does not need to use a picture of
        themselves. Instead, they can create alternative placards for people of
        a certain gender catergory to view. Users can even opt out of showing
        their placard if they truly want to remain anonymous
        <br />
        <br />
        Users have the ability to choose their placards within their user
        settings, where they will usually go to to change their regular Bumble
        profile.

        The most challenging part of making a new component for a Design System
        was making it fit in with the design theme. I had to reuse some icons
        from my Design System (Base) and built them into new components.
        <br />
        <br />
        For example, to demonstrate that something is a Premium feature, I used
        a ribbon icon– which might mean something different in the Uber app. The
        very limited amount of icons made it hard to design because I had to
        make new icons or reuse ones that already existed.

        The most surprising thing I learned about Design Systems was how
        structured they were. There are so many components and parts that go
        into Design Systems that I never thought about. It made me value the
        amount of work that goes into it. When designing with a Design System,
        it makes it easier to create as the overarching themes are already built
        in.

          ○ No desktop website feature offered. Due to this feature being
          location based, bringing a laptop to venues will be challenging. This
          will also help motivate users to use the app more to have the full

        From this project, I learned how to integrate new components and work
        with existing ones in an already built design system. If I had more time
        or more resources, I would definitely spend more time learning about
        micro interactions within Figma. This would help my app feature flow
        more smoothly and seem like a real feature integrated within Bumble. I
        would also want to run interviews and user tests with my feature to see
        how other people would react to it. Since most of my critiques came from
        other designers, I want to see how non-designers or non-HCI people would
        critique my work.
        <br />
        <br />
        If I were to strictly follow the requirements as written, I would have
        missed out on multiple key features I added within my design and it
        would have been missing a lot of design considerations. For example, the
        brief mentions nothing about security and safety for the users when they
        have their location turned on. If I were to not consider this, my
        service would have been a liability to the users and may potentially put
        them in danger of harassment. My service gave the users the option to
        hide themselves or provide an alternative way for people to see them on
        the app to help give them safety via anonymity. To continue, my service
        utilized third parties and the design brief did not say anything about
        how to handle third parties. For this, I had to come up with my own
        ideas on how third parties would view the Bumble app as a partner and I
        settled on creating a separate app called Bumble Partner for them to
        view analytics and create discounts for users.
